To get your course specific account, click on this link:

You should be able to get your username, which would look something like this:

cs15lsp22zz

Then, in Visual Studio Code, open the terminal (Ctrl + `, or Terminal → New Terminal menu) Input command:


$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu


This command line is an example. You would have to input your own username followed by @iend6.ucsd.edu. 

If this is your first time connecting, you should see this message. 


⤇ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.

RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?


Type yes and enter. Then, it would ask for your password. Input the password, you used when obtaining your course specific account. Once you successfully typed your password, you would see this. if ran successful, your terminal will be connected to the computer in the CSE basement.

### Part 4: Moving Files over SSH with scp

Log out of your remote server in your terminal by following the instruction given above. Then, Create a file on your computer called WhereAmI.java and put the following code into it:


class WhereAmI {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
    
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
    
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
    
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
    
  }
  
}
 
 
On the terminal, cd into the area where the file is. Then, run this command. 

scp WhereAmI.java cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/

Again , cs15lsp22zz should be different for everyone based on what they get on the course specific account. After inputting your password. Log into ieng6 with ssh again. Your terminal should look like this. 

For refresher, this is the ssh code:

$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

If ran successfully, you should see this output.

To run the file on the ieng6 computer, run javac and then java. Below should be the output.
